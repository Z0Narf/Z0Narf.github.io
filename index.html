        <h2>Some Essay About Myself</h2>
        <p>It all began when I received a medal in Mathematics competitions and successfully advanced to round 2 in the IPST (Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology) science competition when I was young. This experience sparked my fascination with analytical thinking and the scientific process. Another factor driving my interests is the allure of emerging new technologies. Observing various technological advancements has ignited my creativity. All of these events have motivated me to further strengthening my academic strengths as an analytical thinker and a demonstrator of creativity.

My current project involves the study of piezoelectric materials, specifically focusing on properties of KNbO3 doped with varying percentages of Na. Additionally, I investigate the shifts observed in XRD Rietveld refinement. This project requires a high degree of analytical thinking. I need to analyze the theory and apply them to my project. This project led to my participation in the 23rd Kolmogorov Readings 2023 (earning an Honorable Mention award) and the 18th Siam Physics Progress 2023. Furthermore, it's an exchange project involving the sharing of computational simulation results with real experiments conducted at the Korea Science Academy of KAIST (KSA), Korea. This collaboration has taught me the importance of being attentive and detail-oriented. Moreover, it has motivated me to continually study and seek more information to enhance my project. I aspire to continuously refine my scientific knowledge within the field of engineering along with my critical thinking abilities.

Many activities I have been involved in require analytical thinking, creativity and social skills. The first activity is my role as the president of the Game Creator Club, where I manage to teach others about game creation and suggest creative ideas for game development. The next activity involves a seminar on the topic of human motion detection algorithms. In this seminar, I need to thoroughly analyze everything and then summarize and present the content to help others understand the objectives and methods. Another activity I participate in is assisting with school festivals. Specifically, I am responsible for looking after participants who are joining the Thailand International Science Fair 2023 (TISF).

Therefore, I am a leader in many events at my school. For instance, I serve as a class leader and take on the role of volunteer camp president. As the camp president, I am responsible for deciding on science activities for junior high school students and organizing management meetings for my classmates. This experience highlights my strong leadership skills and my ability to manage and guide others.</p>
